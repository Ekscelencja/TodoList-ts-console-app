# TodoList-ts-console-app
Simple To Do List app written in ts which can be used in cmd via node.

Use TypeScript compiler to create ./dist folder with compiled js and then run the code form index.js file with node.
As simple as that.
For now it is a raw basic app with functionality like adding a task, marking it as complete/incomplete, deleting the complete task.
List of tasks is stored in Todos.json file which is being created by 'lowdb'.
